# Calculator (Point)

**Calculator (Point)** is a Java-based application built with Swing, designed for performing point-based calculations in a 2D space. The application allows users to compute operations like the sum, difference, distance, slope, and other geometric calculations involving points.


## Features

- **Point Operations**: 
  - Sum, difference, and multiplication of two points.
  - Calculation of the slope between points and equation of a line.
  - Distance between points.
  - Scalar multiplication and checking point equality.
  - Determine if two points are collinear or if they form a clockwise angle.

- **Interactive UI**: Built with Java Swing for a graphical interface.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with buttons for operations like sum, subtraction, multiplication, and more.


## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drish1001/Calculator-Point-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Calculator-Point-
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Point.java ScientificCalculator.java
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java ScientificCalculator
   ```

## How It Works

1. Launch the `ScientificCalculator` class to open the application.
2. Input points in the format `(x, y)` using the GUI.
3. Perform various operations such as:
   - Adding, subtracting, multiplying points.
   - Finding the slope between points or the equation of a line.
4. View the results directly within the application.
